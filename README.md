# loan-data-analysis-powerbi
The loan dataset contains detailed information about borrowers, their demographics, financial profiles, and loan characteristics. It includes fields such as loan amount, loan purpose, loan date, credit score, income, employment type, education level, and default status.
The data allows analysis of borrowing behavior, risk patterns, and portfolio performance across different customer segments.
It supports calculations like YOY and YTD loan trends, default rates, and loan distribution by age, credit score bins, and purpose.
Overall, the dataset provides a comprehensive view of loan disbursements and defaults, enabling insights into customer segmentation, credit risk, and financial growth.


# Project Objective
- Analyze loan disbursement patterns across demographic groups (age, education, employment, credit score).
- Identify high-risk borrower segments by evaluating default rates by employment type, year, and credit score groups.
- Track financial performance through Year-Over-Year (YOY) and Year-To-Date (YTD) loan metrics.
- Understand loan purpose distribution to identify which loan types drive the most demand.
- Support decision-making for lending policy, risk mitigation, and customer targeting.

Questions(KPIs)
A. Loan Amount & Portfolio Growth KPIs
- Total Loan Amount
- YTD Loan Amount
- YOY Change in Loan Amount
- Loan Amount by Purpose
- Loan Amount by Education Type
- Loan Amount by Age Group

# Process
- Imported and cleaned the loan dataset using Power Query (handled missing values, formatted dates, created age/score bins).
- Built a proper data model and organized all KPIs into dedicated measure tables.
- Created DAX measures for YOY, YTD, default rate, and segment-wise loan insights.
- Designed interactive visuals (charts, KPIs, slicers) to analyze loan trends, risk segments, and customer behavior.
- Interpreted insights to understand portfolio growth, borrower characteristics, and default patterns.
