# loan-data-analysis-powerbi
Power BI loan analytics dashboard featuring DAX-driven KPIs, YOY/YTD performance tracking, borrower segmentation, and default-risk insights.
This project analyzes loan distribution across demographics, credit score groups, income categories, and loan purposes.
Interactive visuals and measure tables help identify high-risk customer segments, monitor portfolio growth, and support data-driven lending decisions.


# Project Objective
- Analyze loan disbursement patterns across demographic groups (age, education, employment, credit score).
- Identify high-risk borrower segments by evaluating default rates by employment type, year, and credit score groups.
- Track financial performance through Year-Over-Year (YOY) and Year-To-Date (YTD) loan metrics.
- Understand loan purpose distribution to identify which loan types drive the most demand.
- Support decision-making for lending policy, risk mitigation, and customer targeting.

# Questions(KPIs)
# - A. Loan Amount & Portfolio Growth KPIs
- Total Loan Amount
- YTD Loan Amount
- YOY Change in Loan Amount
- Loan Amount by Purpose
- Loan Amount by Education Type
- Loan Amount by Age Group
- Loan Amount by Credit Score Bins
# - B. Credit & Income Segmentation KPIs
- Average Loan Amount by High Credit Score
- Median Loan Amount by Credit Score Bins
- Average Income by Employment Type
# - C. Risk & Default KPIs
- Default Rate by Employment Type
- Default Rate by Year
- YOY Default Loan Change

# Process
- Imported and cleaned the loan dataset using Power Query (handled missing values, formatted dates, created age/score bins).
- Built a proper data model and organized all KPIs into dedicated measure tables.
- Created DAX measures for YOY, YTD, default rate, and segment-wise loan insights.
- Designed interactive visuals (charts, KPIs, slicers) to analyze loan trends, risk segments, and customer behavior.
- Interpreted insights to understand portfolio growth, borrower characteristics, and default patterns.
